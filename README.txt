2012 - CS308  Group 15 : Remote Controlled Robotic Arm
================================================
with Parallel Simulation - README TEMPLATE
================================================


Group Information:

+   B Sravan Kumar (09005046)
+   S Chandra Mouli (09005045)

+   D Venkat Ramana (09005059) 


Project Description
-------------------

The remote control is a mechanical arm which controls the movements of the robotic arm and its jaws. 
Simultaneously, a simulation of the mechanical arm's movement is shown in Blender software in the form a simulation. 
The various degrees of freedom are clearly depicted in the simulation, which helps better understand the movements of both the arms. 

The user makes the desired movements in the mechanical arm which are replicated in the robotic arm, 
thus allowing fexible movements of the arm which can be at a considerable distance from the user.


Technologies Used
-------------------

+   Embedded C
+   Xbee
+   Python 3.2 with PySerial
+   Specialized Hardware (Mechanical Arm)
+   Robotic Arm
+   Blender 2.62


Installation Instructions
=========================

Blender is a free open source 3D content creation suite, available for all major operating systems. It can be download from [here](http://www.blender.org/download/get-blender/). 
No specific installation is required. The executable from the extracted directory can be directly used.

Pyserial compatible with Python 3.2 has been uploaded in our [Github](https://github.com/) repository under the username 'kiranmaruthi'. For convienience direct link to our file is given [here](https://github.com/kiranmaruthi/remotely_controlled_robotic_arm_group12_cs308_2012).
